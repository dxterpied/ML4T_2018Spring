    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will implement the Q-Learning and Dyna-Q solutions to the reinforcement learning problem. You will apply them to a navigation problem in this project. In a later project you will apply them to trading. The reason for working with the navigation problem first is that, as you will see, navigation is an easy problem to work with and understand. Note that your Q-Learning code really shouldn't care which problem it is solving. The difference is that you need to wrap the learner in different code that frames the problem for the learner as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the navigation problem we have created testqlearner.py that automates testing of your Q-Learner in the navigation problem.\n",

    "    * Code a Q-Learner\n",
    "    * Code the Dyna-Q feature of Q-Learning\n",

    "## The navigation task\n",

    "The navigation task takes place in a 10 x 10 grid world. The particular environment is expressed in a CSV file of integers, where the value in each position is interpreted as follows:\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the robot starts at the bottom center, and must navigate to the top left. Note that a wall of obstacles blocks its path, and there is some quicksand along the left side. The objective is for the robot to learn how to navigate from the starting location to the goal with the highest total reward. We define the reward for each step as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-1 if the robot moves to an empty or blank space, or attempts to move into a wall\n",
    "\n",
    "-100 if the robot moves to a quicksand space\n",
    "\n",
    "1 if the robot moves to the goal space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assess\n",
    "Overall, we will assess the performance of a policy as the median reward it incurs to travel from the start to the goal (higher reward is better). We assess a learner in terms of the reward it converges to over a given number of training epochs (trips from start to goal). The problem includes random actions. So, for example, if the learner responds with a \"move north\" action, there is some probability that the robot will actually move in a different direction. For this reason, the \"wise\" learner develops policies that keep the robot well away from quicksand. We map this problem to a reinforcement learning problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**State:** The state is the location of the robot, it is computed (discretized) as: column location * 10 + row location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions:** There are 4 possible actions, 0: move north, 1: move east, 2: move south, 3: move west.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R:** The reward is as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T:** The transition matrix can be inferred from the CSV map and the actions.\n"
